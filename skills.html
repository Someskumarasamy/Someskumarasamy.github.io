                            <P>
                                Problem solving skills means using algorithms which already exsists or designing to solve a problem and making it understandable
                                for machines.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I can design algorithms as well as use those algorithms to make my code work. Whenever I was asked to solve a problem, I
                                break them into snippets any find or design an algorithm for each snippet and combine to
                                present my solutions . In web designing when I was thrown a project I refer to the similar
                                products in the market, get some idea and start developing my project.

                                The critical thinking is a part of problem solving process, but in certain cases that critical thinking plays a vital part
                                which includes testing. I am solo developer the critical thinking skill helps me to test
                                my projects. I test my project mainly based on user views then I go with security issues.
