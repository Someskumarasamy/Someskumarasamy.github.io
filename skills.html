                            <P>
                                Problem-solving skills means using algorithms which already exists or designing to solve a problem and making it understandable
                                for machines.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I can design algorithms as well as use those algorithms to make my code work. Whenever I was asked to solve a problem, I
                                break them into snippets and find or design an algorithm for each snippet and relate them
                                to my solutions.

                            <P>
                                The critical thinking is a part of the problem-solving process, but in certain cases that critical thinking plays a vital
                                part which includes testing. I am solo developer the critical thinking skill helps me to
                                test my projects. I test my project mainly based on user views then I go with security issues.

                                Java, yes its old and lacks many advanced features but most of the new Languages built based on Java. so I learned Java.

                                in Java and handle them in it.

                                Web design includes HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP which forms a basis of any web designing, though I am not master in it I can develop
                                projects in it. This website stands as an example of this skills. I was quite familiar with
                                CSS grids and flexbox.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I use PHP scripting language to handle database actions in web designing, it acts as intermediate to web page and database.
                                I commonly use MongoDB, Mysql.

                                in it using PHP, further learning more in MongoDB university.

                                Data Science/big data - I was very much interested to learn data science, but I didn't meet any prerequisites so keep on
                                trying to find some best platform. you can suggest me any such platforms in the chat box.</p>
                            <p>
                                ChatBot - As my dream projects travel towards AI and I got very impressed with the google assistant which drove me to develop
                                a curiosity to develop a chatbot. I was taking a course which teaches me to build a chat
                                bot on IBM Watson.</p>
                            <p>
                                These are some of my area of interest, You can also suggest me some tech that has an innovative in future. suggestions can
                                be made by chat and mail.
