                                At age 5, I was put into the school, Shanthi Nikethan Nursery and Primary Schhol, Dharapuram when I came out of it I was
                                12. this school saw a boy who cries for his mom to the boy who cheers to learn. This school
                                had a strength about 100 with a great quality of education and care. this school shaped me
                                with fine qualities and a created a interest in education. I can still remember those days
                                but when I do so tears shed from my eyes...
