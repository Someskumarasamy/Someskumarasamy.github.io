                            <p>Hi, I am Somes Kumar Kumarasamy born on 31st Jan 1998 at Dharapuram, a small town in Tamil Nadu.
                                I am a budding software engineer with a thirst for learning. I love to innovate things that
                                make our life better. I like to play in teams as a member as well as a leader. I prefer to
                                work at night than in the morning.
                            </p>

                            <p>My workflow starts with paper and pen where I design the projects idea, layout, functionality,
                                use cases and its tech stack and divide my work into phases. then I start to develop a model
                                of the project as side by side I'll start to learn the stack if it is new. Finally, I start
                                to build my project simultaneously I go for a functionality check.

                            <p>I am a self-motivated guy, but I get inspired a lot. I get inspired by every person who has a
                                skill that lacked in me. Most particularly, my parents, they were my first teachers. Other
                                than them, Abdul Kalam taught me about simplicity. Alon Musk, taught me about dreams, Nicola
                                Tesla showed me about concentration. Vasili Arkhipov showed me the value of patience. much
